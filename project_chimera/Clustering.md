# Clustering
Once we have a list of keywords/phrases for each text document from the [[Keyword Extraction]] component for the choosen corpus (domain), we can cluster the list of keys into various similarity groups.

A cluster is refers to a collection of keywords/phrases aggregated together because of certain similarities. 

A few clustering algorithms that we can leverage for this task are
- [[K-means]]
- [[Community Detection]]

By clustering the keys, we create a level of grouped keys creating a graph like structure.
